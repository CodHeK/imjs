## Editing styles
- Custom styles go in styles.less. Do not edit styles.css. You can write standard css in styles.less, but it's more fun to [learn a little bit about less](http://lesscss.org/).
- install a less compiler (`npm install -g less`) and run `lessc styles.less styles.css` to convert the less to css.
- prism.css is for the syntax highlighting. do not edit it. https://prismjs.com
